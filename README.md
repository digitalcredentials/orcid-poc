# ORCID POC

A proof of concept demonstrating how credentials like a diploma or work history - that have been issued as Verifiable Credentials - can be uploaded to the credential holder's ORCID profile as trustworthy assertions.

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

At the moment there is a single page, which you can edit: `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


## Next.js

This app was built with Next.js:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
